Dependencies:
gcc, zlib, gtk+ (2 or 3)

The currently supported platforms are: linux and windows (mac is barely supported)

Contact me (llasarus@gmail.com) if you're an experienced Mac c++/c developer and can fix the Mac port.

If you're compiling this on anything but Linux you'll probably need to make your own build system,
and if you have I would be very happy if you could send it and instructions on how to use it to me.

build with:
# make <platform>

The binaries are located in "bin/<platform>/".

# Mac Build

Install dependencies through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) using the following command:

```
brew install gtk pkg-config
```
